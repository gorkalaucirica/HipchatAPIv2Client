## Installation

The recommended way to install Hipchatv2ApiClient is through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).
To install this library, run the command below and you will get the latest version:

    composer require gorkalaucirica/hipchat-v2-api-client
    
## Usage

All queries need the following two lines. The first one is to authenticate yourself and the second one creates a
client that is used by the API classes to perform requests to the API. That is enough to start, now check the API calls
section to see how to use the `$client` to send requests to the API.

    use GorkaLaucirica\HipchatAPIv2Client\Auth\OAuth2;
    use GorkaLaucirica\HipchatAPIv2Client\Client;

    $auth = new OAuth2('tokenYouCanGetInHipchatSite');
    $client = new Client($auth);
    
## Client for private instances

After version 1.5.0 you can set the URL in the constructor to change the base url used by the client (by default uses 
`https://api.hipchat.com`

    $client = new Client($auth, null, 'https.//api.yourdomain.com');

## API calls

All API call methods are located in the API folder. All of them have been documented and all have a link to Hipchat v2
API documentation. Some examples:

#### Getting user by mention name:

    use GorkaLaucirica\HipchatAPIv2Client\API\UserAPI;

    $userAPI = new UserAPI($client);
    $user = $userAPI->getUser('@gorkalaucirica');

#### Getting all rooms
    
    use GorkaLaucirica\HipchatAPIv2Client\API\RoomAPI;

    $roomAPI = new RoomAPI($client);
    $room = $roomAPI->getRooms(array('max-results' => 30));
